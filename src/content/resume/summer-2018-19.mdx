### Summer 2018

I joined as a one-off summer placement, and was impactful enough to inspire
the technical manager to start a summer placement scheme.
Here, I worked with skilled software engineers to pick up vital design, programming, and team-work skills.
As part of this, I created an internal data storage system to support employees in other areas of the business.

### Summer 2019

I was invited back over my second summer at University, where I again got to work with experienced developers.
This time, I developed a central feedback site which integrated with their existing internal systems.
This reduced friction for non-technical users to report issues in the systems, and have that feedback go straight to the development team.
Additionally, I ported an existing Access/VB system which was older than me to a brand-new SQL backend
to reduce load times from tens of minutes to single seconds.

### Responsibilities

- Developing existing desktop applications using C# & WPF
- Designing and creating internal web systems in C#, ASP.NET Core, & Blazor on Azure
- Meeting with customers from across the business to identify and prioritise their business requirements
- Collaborated with other developers to produce high-quality systems to streamline business processes
- Ported a 20+ year old Access/VB system to SQL Server

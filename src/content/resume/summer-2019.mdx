### Summary

After a successful [Summer 2018 placement](./summer-2018),
I was invited back over my second summer at University.

My first project was to migrate an existing Access/VB system (which was older than me!) to a brand-new SQL backend.
This reduced load times from tens of minutes to single seconds, massively streamlining the process for users.

My other project was to develop a central feedback site which integrated with their existing internal systems.
This reduced friction for non-technical users to report issues in the systems,
and have that feedback go straight to the development team.

During this time, I also explored the brand-new Blazor technology,
demonstrating and pitching it to internal technical stakeholders.

### Responsibilities

- Porting a 20+ year old Access/VB system to SQL Server
- Designing and creating internal web systems in C#, ASP.NET Core, & Blazor on Azure
- Collaborating extensively with the wider tech team to get a broader view of tech development
- Researching and pitching new technologies to internal technical stakeholders

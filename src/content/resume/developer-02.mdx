### Summary

I joined my current company (which traditionally offered managed services/low-code solutions) in early 2021 as a junior developer.
I leveraged my experience in mature development teams to shape the growth of a brand-new custom development team, and define technology and development strategies.

Fast forward to today, and I report to the board as the Principal Software Engineer.
My day-to-day is spent developing solutions, collaborating with stakeholders, and leading the team to deliver digital transformation and process improvements.

From time to time, I also love getting stuck into everything else the team does.
On top of my usual project work, I manage our DevOps processes, adopt coding/solution standards,
design our technology stack, write internal systems and libraries, run interviews, mentor colleagues,
and whatever else is needed to keep the team running smoothly.

### Responsibilities

- Architecting and leading agile delivery of high quality, bespoke experiences for clients
- Collaborating with a range of stakeholders to discover business requirements and opportunities for innovation
- Defining short through long-term technology strategies, creating robust guidelines for ensuring software quality, and leading their adoption
- Providing leadership across the team, driving technical evolution, and constantly striving to improve our processes and workflows
- Empowering the development team and acting as the escalation path for technical issues
- Running interviews for new hires, and designing/managing our technical test process/site
- Supporting existing and legacy systems to ensure clients face minimal disruption

### Summary

I joined my current company (which traditionally offered managed services/low-code solutions) in early 2021 as a junior developer.
I leveraged my experience in mature development teams to shape the growth of their brand-new custom development team, and defined pivotal technological and development strategies.

Fast forward to today, and I report to the board as the Principal Software Engineer.
My day-to-day is spent developing solutions, collaborating with stakeholders, and leading the team to deliver digital transformation and process improvements.

I also love getting stuck into everything else the team does from time to time. On top of my usual project work, I:
- manage our DevOps processes
- define solution standards/best practices
- design our technology stack
- write internal systems and libraries
- run interviews
- mentor colleagues
- whatever else is needed to keep the team running smoothly!

### Responsibilities

- Designing and leading the implementation of complex systems, making pragmatic decisions factoring in requirements, technical debt, and business priorities
- Consistently owning the delivery of large-scale new projects and changes, and collaborating with engineers and stakeholders to ensure successful outcomes
- Articulating difficult technical ideas with stakeholders internally and externally
- Proactively staying up-to-date with technology trends, both in my area and across the board, and using that knowledge to inform our roadmaps
- Confidently tackling vague/complex requirements, and breaking them down into actionable items and objectives
- Setting multi-year tech strategies in line with technical requirements and business goals, getting broad buy-in, and bringing engineers on board
- Defining best practices and standards for non-functional project requirements (eg testing, performance, and security)
- Supporting hiring efforts for new engineers, from junior through to senior
- Providing mentoring, constructive feedback, and assistance for engineers
- Acting as a reliable problem solver and escalation point for technical challenges
- Leading by example by creating high-quality designs, code, and documentation
- Supporing existing and legacy systems to ensure clients face minimal disruption

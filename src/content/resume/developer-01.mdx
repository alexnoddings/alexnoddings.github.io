### Summary

This company had a myriad of disorganised technical systems written by their traditional engineers in Access, SQL, and Python.
I was brought in with software engineering experience to organise and migrate their systems,
optimise their database, and train their engineers in Python development and best practices.

### Responsibilities

- Migrated internal systems from an EoL version of Access to a new SQL backend
- Optimised their existing database, unlocking up to 100x performance benefits on complex, long-running queries
- Independently identified manual processes across the business which could be automated
- Abstracted an existing piece of embedded software to run in a simulation,
  allowing engineers to more rapidly prototype alterations and changes to the product and control code
- Trained engineers in Python scripting to help them automate tasks and better design their embedded code

### Summary

I joined as a one-off summer placement, and was impactful enough to inspire the technical manager to start a summer placement scheme.
Here, I worked with skilled software engineers to pick up vital design, programming, and team-work skills.
As part of this, I created an internal data storage system to support employees in other areas of the business.

This placement was successful enough that [I was invited back next summer](./summer-2019).

### Responsibilities

- Maintaining existing desktop applications using C# & WPF
- Helping develop an internal web system in C#, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core
- Meeting with customers from across the business to identify and prioritise their business requirements
- Collaborated with other developers to produce high-quality systems to streamline business processes

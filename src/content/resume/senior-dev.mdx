### Summary

I joined my current company as a junior developer as they began to seriously explore high code solutions.
Since then, I have been instrumental in shaping the direction of the cloud apps team.
Fast forward to today, and I'm a senior developer responsible for
leading technical innovation and new technology adoption.

On top of my technical responsibilities, I mentor other developers and collaborate
with people outside of my team (e.g. sales and PMs) to introduce the wider business to new technologies and concepts.
I also work with the technical director to run 2nd stage interviews,
and maintain our pre-interview technical test system.

### Responsibilities

- Architect and deliver high-quality, bespoke, robust systems for
  a range of clients primarily in ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and React
- Provide technical leadership within the cloud apps team by exploring new technology,
  implementing best practices, and constantly striving to improve our processes and workflows
- Run technical interviews for new devs, and design and manage our technical test system
- Collaborate with clients and other developers to discover and fulfill business requirements
- Maintain existing and legacy systems to ensure clients face minimal disruption

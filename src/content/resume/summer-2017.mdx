### Summary

I joined as a Service Desk Analyst for a summer placement before university.
This role started as a first-line analyst where I engaged with customers from over 30 countries around the globe
to quickly identify and resolve technical issues they faced.

Later, this morphed into working with Service Delivery Managers to improve access to information for analysts.
Their existing knowledge base was a loose collection of thousands of Word documents, which required
a lot of understanding to navigate.
I designed a script in Python to automatically open and analyse these documents to suggest keywords
to tag files with, greatly boosting analyst productivity by allowing them to effectively search the system.

### Responsibilities

- Worked with users from across the globe to resolve technical issues quickly and efficiently
- Managed systems, remotely triaging issues, and administrating their Active Directory
- Worked with other Analysts and Technical Engineers to triage and solve business issues quickly
- Created a Python system to vastly improve access to Knowledge Base documents for other Analysts

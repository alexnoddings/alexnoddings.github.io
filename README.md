My personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Running locally
The site can be ran locally by executing `npm run dev` in the root directory. This runs the site in dev mode.

### Building for deployment
The site provides some static files (favicons, a PDF, and an open graph image). Rather than store and update these individually, they are generated by endpoints under `/pages/~gen/` which use Puppeteer to load and export a page. These break when built for deployment via `npm run build` as the site isn't running.

Instead, you need to build the static files. Note that the generated files should not be checked in, and that this process modifies the repository. It is advised to revert any changes made once the build is complete.

The `build-static-files.sh` script handles running the dev server, building static files, then building the prod site. It can run in WSL, though you will need [some dependencies](https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting#running-puppeteer-on-wsl-windows-subsystem-for-linux) installed to generate the static files.
